Repo to store Python Scripts


Dockerfile creates image that installs python3 on ubuntu, runs a script and exits

v0.5 runs "Hello! Goodbye!" and exits

v1.3 has a complete Getting-started-w-Python directory with python scripts. The resulting container does various things based on the version.

Idea to add welcome screen that welcomes to the linux arcade, then allows you to choose which game to play. As long as its not quit then it allows you to play another python game.

Current games: 
Rock paper Scissors
Hangman
(Developing) Poker
